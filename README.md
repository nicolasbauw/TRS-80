# TRuSt-80

This is a demonstration / development TRS-80 emulator based on my [Z80 emulator](https://github.com/nicolasbauw/ZilogZ80).
This is NOT (for now) a fully working TRS-80 emulator.
You will need a ROM (this [diagnostic ROM](https://github.com/misterblack1/trs80-diagnosticrom/blob/main/trs80m13diag.bin) for example), and the [AnotherMansTreasureMIB64C2X3Y.ttf](https://www.kreativekorp.com/swdownload/fonts/retro/amtreasure.zip) font.

To run:
```
cargo run
```

You can customize the RAM, ROM and resolution in the config.toml file.
